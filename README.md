# DIY DNA Reporting
## What is this?
The roughest draft of a tool to quickly make reports from your raw 23andMe data.

# Why bother?
Most tools I found required uploading to a server, so this one doesn't touch the internet at all.

# What does it do?
Currently there is a sample report for "methylation". If this actually tells you anything is up for considerable debate.

You can also make your own reports using the same structure, and make your own claims to spur even more debates!

# How do I run it?

Requires tabulate, install with `pip install tabulate`

Run the opendjinn.py with `python diyDnaReport.py <report.json> <23andMeData.txt>`
